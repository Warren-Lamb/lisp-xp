# lisp-xp

This is me following along with a neat little Lisp creation described by Will Speak. https://willspeak.me/2019/07/10/lisp-in-two-days-with-rust.html.

Of course I am starting in a half-assed backward manner with the evaluation module because that is the way my brain works.  The hashmapped global environment, mapping functions to the eval fn call based upon the expression input which provides the vector args is realy neat stuff.
